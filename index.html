        <h2>Brief History and Origin of Cristiano Ronaldo</h2>
        <div id="early-life">
          <p><em>Early Life</em></p>
          <p>
            Born Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro on February 5, 1985, in
            Funchal, Madeira, Portugal, a small island off the western coast of
            the country, Ronaldo is the youngest of four children born to Maria
            Dolores dos Santos and Jose Dinis Aveiro. He was named after Ronald
            Reagan, one of his father's favorite actors.

        <p>
          It was through his dad's work as an equipment manager at a boy's club
          that Ronaldo was first introduced to the game of soccer. By the time
          he was 10 years old, he was already recognized as a phenomenon—a kid
          who ate, slept and drank the game. "All he wanted to do as a boy was
          play football," his godfather, Fernao Sousa, recalled for British
          reporters, adding, "He loved the game so much he'd miss meals or
          escape out of his bedroom window with a ball when he was supposed to
          be doing his homework." By his early teens, Ronaldo's talent and
          legend had grown considerably. After a stint with Nacional da liha da
          Madeira, he signed with Sporting Portugal in 2001. That same year, at
          the tender age of 16, Ronaldo turned heads with a mesmerizing
          performance against Manchester United, wowing even his opponents with
          his footwork and deft skill. He made such an impression that a number
          of United players asked their manager to try and sign the young
          player. It wasn't long before the club paid Ronaldo's team more than
          £12 million for his services - a record fee for a player of his age.

          <p>
            Ronaldo did not disappoint the soccer world. He showed his promise
            early on in the 2004 FA Cup final, scoring the team's first three
            goals and helping them capture the championship. In 2008, a year
            after signing a five-year, £31 million contract, Ronaldo again
            justified his high salary when he put together one of the club's
            finest seasons in history, setting a franchise record for goals
            scored (42), and earning himself the FIFA World of the Year honor.
            In all, Ronaldo helped steer Manchester United to three premier
            league titles. But Ronaldo's time in England was marred by his
            mother's 2007 struggle with breast cancer as well as his father's
            death from alcohol-related illness. The latter was especially hard
            for Ronaldo as the two had been close, and the young athlete had
            often pushed for his father to enter rehab and address his drinking.
            His father, however, never accepted the offer.

          <p><em>Real Madrid and Portugal</em></p>
          <p>
            As lauded as Ronaldo was on the field for Manchester United, his
            commitment to the club came under constant question. Speculation
            swirled that he wanted to play elsewhere. So in 2009, when Spanish
            soccer club Real Madrid agreed to pay United a record $131 million
            for the chance to sign him, nobody was all that surprised to see
            Ronaldo leave United. "I know that they are going to demand a lot of
            me to be successful at the club and I know that I'm going to have
            much more pressure than at Manchester United because I was there for
            many years," Ronaldo told reporters. "But it means a new challenge
            and is going to help me be the best footballer." In addition to his
            FIFA World Player of the year award, Ronaldo has also won the
            coveted Ballon d'OR, the Golden Boot, and been named the UEFA Club
            Forward of the Year, among other honors during the course of his
            career. On July 10, 2016, Ronaldo added another emotional victory to
            his accolades, leading Portugal to the European Championship final
            against France as his national team's captain. Although he was
            sidelined after suffering a knee injury 25 minutes into the match,
            Portugal went on to win the championship title 1-0, their first
            international trophy. Ronaldo's teammates said that he motivated
            them as team captain from the sidelines. "He gave us a lot of
            confidence and he said, 'Listen people, I'm sure we will win this
            Euro so stay together and fight for it,’” full-back Cedric Soares
            said after Portugal’s victory. "This is one of the happiest moments
            in my career,” Ronaldo commented. ”I’ve always said I wanted to win
            a trophy with the national team and make history. And I did it.
            Thank God, things went well for us." In January 2017, Ronaldo won
            FIFA's 2016 best player of the year for the fourth time, beating out
            Lionel Messi. Ronaldo’s 2016 wins included the European
            Championship, Champions League, and Club World Cup, plus individual
            awards from UEFA and France Football magazine, according to USA
            Today. In his acceptance speech, Ronaldo said: "2016 was the best
            year of my career."

        <p>
          In 2018 Cristiano Ronaldo agreed to a move to Italy, to join Juventus
          in a deal that will see him earn a whooping 24 million Euros per year.
          This deal cost the Turin outlet a staggering 97 million Euros to
          complete the transfer negotiations with Real Madrid. In Juventus,
          Ronaldo won the Italian Scudetto, in 2019,2020, and won the Italian
          MVP on both occasions. He also won the Italian Super-Cup twice while
          with Juventus.
